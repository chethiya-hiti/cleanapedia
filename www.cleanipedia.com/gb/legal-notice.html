Cleanipedia is for YOU and we want you to make the most of it. However, because what you write or upload on Cleanipedia can be seen by thousands of visitors, we’ve engaged a professional moderator to filter out inappropriate material. There are some things that just shouldn’t be shared. This is not censorship. We’re trying to protect all our visitors and, above all, the reputation of Cleanipedia and Unilever. We don’t want to reject content unless you want us to. So make sure your content is appropriate by reading the Moderation Guidelines below.</p><h2>Access Restricted To UK Residents</h2><p style=\"\">Cleanipedia is only available to residents in the United Kingdom.</p><h2>Original Content and Third Party Rights</h2><p style=\"\">Content must not include material that is protected by copyright, bound by obligations of confidentiality, or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights (including, without limitation, trade marks, trade names, privacy and publicity rights) unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material.</p><p style=\"\">We will reject content if we believe, in our reasonable opinion, that you are not the author of, or you do not have the necessary rights to, that content. This would include, for example:</p><ul style=\"list-style-position: inside;\"><li>music and music videos</li><li>lyrics and other literary works</li><li>news footage, sports highlights, etc.</li><li>viral content (e.g. extreme sports, funny cats etc.)</li><li>watermarks denoting copyright protection</li><li>advertising and promotional materials</li><li>branding, logos and trademarks</li><li>confidential information or trade secrets</li></ul><h2>Incidental Inclusion</h2><p style=\"\">In very limited cases, the incidental inclusion of copyright works, brands, logos and trademarks in content may be acceptable.</p><p style=\"\">For example, music will generally be rejected because we are unable to verify that you own all the necessary rights to include it in your post. However, if a video features a cleaning tutorial where, for a brief moment, music can be heard from a radio in the background, then we may accept it. In this example, the music is purely incidental to the clip.</p><h2>Personal Details</h2><p style=\"\">Content containing personal details may be rejected. First names or surnames (but not full names), age and hometown may be accepted but contact information, including schools, workplaces, telephone numbers, addresses etc. will not.</p><h2>Protecting Other People’s Rights</h2><p style=\"\">Before uploading content to Cleanipedia, you must obtain permission from any identifiable individual portrayed or referred to in it. If content depicts individuals in a private situation seemingly unaware that they are being photographed or filmed, it may be rejected.</p><p style=\"\">In some circumstances, activities may be unacceptable even if they are lawful, particularly if a person is seen acting against their will or under duress. We may reject content if we believe, in our reasonable opinion, that it exposes an individual to mockery or humiliation.</p><p style=\"\">If Unilever receives a complaint from an individual featured in any material uploaded or linked to/from Cleanipedia against their will, we will block access to that content immediately and, if we see fit (at our sole discretion), we will remove the offending content. We reserve the right to permanently remove or delete content if we believe it infringes or violates an individual’s rights or otherwise violates the law.</p><h2>Defamatory Statements</h2><p style=\"\">Any statement or comment about a person or organisation that may be considered damaging to their reputation and/or interests will not be permitted. A verbal or written statement may be defamatory if it harms reputation by:</p><ul style=\"list-style-position: inside;\"><li>exposing the individual or organisation to hatred, ridicule or contempt;</li><li>causing the individual or organisation to be shunned or avoided;</li><li>lowering the individual or organisation in the estimation of right-thinking members of society; or</li><li>disparaging the office, profession or trade of the individual or organisation.</li></ul><p style=\"\">Allegations about adultery, corruption, dishonesty and sexual orientation could be defamatory and are likely to be rejected in all cases.</p><h2>Discrimination</h2><p style=\"\">Discrimination or prejudice based upon race, colour, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability or veteran status will not be tolerated.</p><p style=\"\">This does not preclude content from discussing or commenting on sensitive topics. However, while context is exceptionally important, the context will not always be clear from the content alone. Consequently, any content that is or appears to be discriminatory or prejudicial, will be rejected.</p><p style=\"\">We will not tolerate any retaliation against anyone complaining of discrimination.</p><h2>Blasphemy and Religious Imagery</h2><p style=\"\">We will not tolerate any content that is blasphemous, or contains offensive or extremist views. Content that could incite religious hatred will be rejected.</p><p style=\"\">The depiction of religious imagery can cause serious offence and is likely to be rejected irrespective of the context in which it appears.</p><h2>Illegal, Criminal or Immoral Acts</h2><p style=\"\">Content depicting, discussing, glamorising or condoning illegal, criminal or immoral acts will be rejected. This includes, without limitation, the abuse of drugs, solvents or other banned substances, the depiction of explosive materials, firearms or other offensive weapons, terrorism, vandalism, theft, arson, prostitution, pimping, stalking, etc.</p><p style=\"\">We reserve the right to pass content to the relevant authorities, including the Police, without notice to you.</p><h2>Contempt of Court and Breach of a Court Order</h2><p style=\"\">It is an offence to publish material that creates a real risk of the course of justice in legal proceedings being seriously impeded or prejudiced. This could include previous convictions, assertions of guilt or confessions. This only applies to active proceedings.</p><p style=\"\">It is also an offence to breach a Court Order. For example, if a court has ordered that the identity of a defendant be kept anonymous, you will commit an offence if you disclose that person’s identity.</p><p style=\"\">If we have reason to believe that content could be in contempt of Court or in breach of a Court Order, it will be rejected.</p><h2>Violence, Harassment and Cruelty</h2><p style=\"\">Cleanipedia is not a forum for personal or private vendettas. We will reject any content containing direct or indirect threats against a person, or content that is otherwise harassing, bullying or abusive.</p><p style=\"\">Content depicting, describing or commenting on cruel or violent acts, including self-harm, harm to others or harm to animals, will be rejected even if made in jest. Similarly, any content inciting, glamorising or condoning violence, past violence or the threat of violence will also be rejected.</p><h2>Dangerous, Antisocial and Irresponsible Acts</h2><p style=\"\">Content should contain nothing that condones or encourages unsafe, irresponsible or antisocial behaviour.</p><p style=\"\">Antisocial, disruptive or destructive content, including “trolling”, “flaming”, “griefing”, “flooding” or “spamming” (as commonly understood), will be rejected.</p><h2>Swear words and profanities</h2><p style=\"\">Language is very personal. What is acceptable to some is highly offensive to others. Moreover, words mean different things to different people and their interpretation often depends on the context in which they are used.</p><p style=\"\">Content containing language deemed inappropriate will be removed from Cleanipedia. If you want to make sure your content remains, don’t:</p><ul style=\"list-style-position: inside;\"><li>use language you wouldn’t use in front of other people</li><li>swear; or</li><li>directly swear at someone - personal attacks will not be tolerated</li></ul><h2>Sex</h2><p style=\"\">Content depicting, or comments describing, pornography, child pornography, sexual assault, obscenity, explicit sexual acts, genitalia, voyeurism or other inappropriate sexual content will be rejected.</p><h2>Foreign Languages, Slang, Code &amp; Hidden Meanings</h2><p style=\"\">Content containing foreign languages, slang, code or hidden meanings (e.g. “email me at user292 at cold male”) will be rejected by Unilever, particularly if its meaning is unclear or inappropriate.</p><p style=\"\">We will reject anything that disrupts the normal flow of the conversation.. Content containing garbled or nonsense sentences, or duplicated words or numbers, will also be rejected.</p><h2>Criticism and Review</h2><p style=\"\">We endeavour not to censor criticism of products or services provided the criticism is made in a fair, respectful and civil manner. However, we will not tolerate inappropriate or malicious language, content or tone, particularly where it could harm the reputation of the company involved.</p><h2>Advertising and Promotional Material</h2><p style=\"\">Cleanipedia is not a commercial forum. Commercial messages, endorsements and/or solicitations for products and services will not be allowed.</p><p style=\"\">Offers to sell goods or services will be rejected along with commercial self-promotion. This includes junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, and any other form of unauthorised solicitation.</p><h2>Report Content</h2><p style=\"\">If you wish to flag abusive, offensive or otherwise inappropriate content, then the best way is to use the \"Report\" function that appears on each Cleanipedia post. In this case, please select a reason for the report, i.e. Inappropriate, Irrelevant to Topic, Potential Spam, or Other, and provide any additional detail helpful to our review. We will promptly review all reports in light of these Moderation Guidelines and the website Terms of Use and take appropriate action.</p>","globalPageUrls":{"profilePagePath":""},"locale":"en-GB","descriptionForLoggedInUsers":"","randomNumber":"04517b9bc395190c1a3e58623c721cc4","componentName":"richTextV2","brandName":"cleanipedia","cookielessExperience":true,"rtl":"false","componentNotSupportedMessage":"The feature is not available on your device, to enjoy the full experience, please visit our website on desktop, tablets or smartphones.","market":"en_gb","errorPagePath":"","anchorTitle":"Click here to go to link","displayDifferentTextForLoggedInUsers":false,"style":{"type":"type-b","class":"legal"},"componentExperienceVariant":"default","additionalBrands":[]},"viewType":"defaultView","randomNumber":"04517b9bc395190c1a3e58623c721cc4","isContainer":false,"resourceType":"unilever-iea/components/richTextV2"}}

Cleanipedia is for YOU and we want you to make the most of it. However, because what you write or upload on Cleanipedia can be seen by thousands of visitors, we’ve engaged a professional moderator to filter out inappropriate material. There are some things that just shouldn’t be shared. This is not censorship. We’re trying to protect all our visitors and, above all, the reputation of Cleanipedia and Unilever. We don’t want to reject content unless you want us to. So make sure your content is appropriate by reading the Moderation Guidelines below.</p><h2>Access Restricted To UK Residents</h2><p style="">Cleanipedia is only available to residents in the United Kingdom.</p><h2>Original Content and Third Party Rights</h2><p style="">Content must not include material that is protected by copyright, bound by obligations of confidentiality, or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights (including, without limitation, trade marks, trade names, privacy and publicity rights) unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material.</p><p style="">We will reject content if we believe, in our reasonable opinion, that you are not the author of, or you do not have the necessary rights to, that content. This would include, for example:</p><ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>music and music videos</li><li>lyrics and other literary works</li><li>news footage, sports highlights, etc.</li><li>viral content (e.g. extreme sports, funny cats etc.)</li><li>watermarks denoting copyright protection</li><li>advertising and promotional materials</li><li>branding, logos and trademarks</li><li>confidential information or trade secrets</li></ul><h2>Incidental Inclusion</h2><p style="">In very limited cases, the incidental inclusion of copyright works, brands, logos and trademarks in content may be acceptable.</p><p style="">For example, music will generally be rejected because we are unable to verify that you own all the necessary rights to include it in your post. However, if a video features a cleaning tutorial where, for a brief moment, music can be heard from a radio in the background, then we may accept it. In this example, the music is purely incidental to the clip.</p><h2>Personal Details</h2><p style="">Content containing personal details may be rejected. First names or surnames (but not full names), age and hometown may be accepted but contact information, including schools, workplaces, telephone numbers, addresses etc. will not.</p><h2>Protecting Other People’s Rights</h2><p style="">Before uploading content to Cleanipedia, you must obtain permission from any identifiable individual portrayed or referred to in it. If content depicts individuals in a private situation seemingly unaware that they are being photographed or filmed, it may be rejected.</p><p style="">In some circumstances, activities may be unacceptable even if they are lawful, particularly if a person is seen acting against their will or under duress. We may reject content if we believe, in our reasonable opinion, that it exposes an individual to mockery or humiliation.</p><p style="">If Unilever receives a complaint from an individual featured in any material uploaded or linked to/from Cleanipedia against their will, we will block access to that content immediately and, if we see fit (at our sole discretion), we will remove the offending content. We reserve the right to permanently remove or delete content if we believe it infringes or violates an individual’s rights or otherwise violates the law.</p><h2>Defamatory Statements</h2><p style="">Any statement or comment about a person or organisation that may be considered damaging to their reputation and/or interests will not be permitted. A verbal or written statement may be defamatory if it harms reputation by:</p><ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>exposing the individual or organisation to hatred, ridicule or contempt;</li><li>causing the individual or organisation to be shunned or avoided;</li><li>lowering the individual or organisation in the estimation of right-thinking members of society; or</li><li>disparaging the office, profession or trade of the individual or organisation.</li></ul><p style="">Allegations about adultery, corruption, dishonesty and sexual orientation could be defamatory and are likely to be rejected in all cases.</p><h2>Discrimination</h2><p style="">Discrimination or prejudice based upon race, colour, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability or veteran status will not be tolerated.</p><p style="">This does not preclude content from discussing or commenting on sensitive topics. However, while context is exceptionally important, the context will not always be clear from the content alone. Consequently, any content that is or appears to be discriminatory or prejudicial, will be rejected.</p><p style="">We will not tolerate any retaliation against anyone complaining of discrimination.</p><h2>Blasphemy and Religious Imagery</h2><p style="">We will not tolerate any content that is blasphemous, or contains offensive or extremist views. Content that could incite religious hatred will be rejected.</p><p style="">The depiction of religious imagery can cause serious offence and is likely to be rejected irrespective of the context in which it appears.</p><h2>Illegal, Criminal or Immoral Acts</h2><p style="">Content depicting, discussing, glamorising or condoning illegal, criminal or immoral acts will be rejected. This includes, without limitation, the abuse of drugs, solvents or other banned substances, the depiction of explosive materials, firearms or other offensive weapons, terrorism, vandalism, theft, arson, prostitution, pimping, stalking, etc.</p><p style="">We reserve the right to pass content to the relevant authorities, including the Police, without notice to you.</p><h2>Contempt of Court and Breach of a Court Order</h2><p style="">It is an offence to publish material that creates a real risk of the course of justice in legal proceedings being seriously impeded or prejudiced. This could include previous convictions, assertions of guilt or confessions. This only applies to active proceedings.</p><p style="">It is also an offence to breach a Court Order. For example, if a court has ordered that the identity of a defendant be kept anonymous, you will commit an offence if you disclose that person’s identity.</p><p style="">If we have reason to believe that content could be in contempt of Court or in breach of a Court Order, it will be rejected.</p><h2>Violence, Harassment and Cruelty</h2><p style="">Cleanipedia is not a forum for personal or private vendettas. We will reject any content containing direct or indirect threats against a person, or content that is otherwise harassing, bullying or abusive.</p><p style="">Content depicting, describing or commenting on cruel or violent acts, including self-harm, harm to others or harm to animals, will be rejected even if made in jest. Similarly, any content inciting, glamorising or condoning violence, past violence or the threat of violence will also be rejected.</p><h2>Dangerous, Antisocial and Irresponsible Acts</h2><p style="">Content should contain nothing that condones or encourages unsafe, irresponsible or antisocial behaviour.</p><p style="">Antisocial, disruptive or destructive content, including “trolling”, “flaming”, “griefing”, “flooding” or “spamming” (as commonly understood), will be rejected.</p><h2>Swear words and profanities</h2><p style="">Language is very personal. What is acceptable to some is highly offensive to others. Moreover, words mean different things to different people and their interpretation often depends on the context in which they are used.</p><p style="">Content containing language deemed inappropriate will be removed from Cleanipedia. If you want to make sure your content remains, don’t:</p><ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>use language you wouldn’t use in front of other people</li><li>swear; or</li><li>directly swear at someone - personal attacks will not be tolerated</li></ul><h2>Sex</h2><p style="">Content depicting, or comments describing, pornography, child pornography, sexual assault, obscenity, explicit sexual acts, genitalia, voyeurism or other inappropriate sexual content will be rejected.</p><h2>Foreign Languages, Slang, Code &amp; Hidden Meanings</h2><p style="">Content containing foreign languages, slang, code or hidden meanings (e.g. “email me at user292 at cold male”) will be rejected by Unilever, particularly if its meaning is unclear or inappropriate.</p><p style="">We will reject anything that disrupts the normal flow of the conversation.. Content containing garbled or nonsense sentences, or duplicated words or numbers, will also be rejected.</p><h2>Criticism and Review</h2><p style="">We endeavour not to censor criticism of products or services provided the criticism is made in a fair, respectful and civil manner. However, we will not tolerate inappropriate or malicious language, content or tone, particularly where it could harm the reputation of the company involved.</p><h2>Advertising and Promotional Material</h2><p style="">Cleanipedia is not a commercial forum. Commercial messages, endorsements and/or solicitations for products and services will not be allowed.</p><p style="">Offers to sell goods or services will be rejected along with commercial self-promotion. This includes junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, and any other form of unauthorised solicitation.</p><h2>Report Content</h2><p style="">If you wish to flag abusive, offensive or otherwise inappropriate content, then the best way is to use the "Report" function that appears on each Cleanipedia post. In this case, please select a reason for the report, i.e. Inappropriate, Irrelevant to Topic, Potential Spam, or Other, and provide any additional detail helpful to our review. We will promptly review all reports in light of these Moderation Guidelines and the website Terms of Use and take appropriate action.</p></div>
